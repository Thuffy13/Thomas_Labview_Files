# Labview Files

This repository will act to place all of the labivew vi's created over the summer into one central location for easy access and commits.

## Installation

The necessary dependencies for these labview vi's include installing LabVIEW through the national Intruments website. Within LabVIEW you will also need to install the NI-DAWmx driver as well as the CANOpen - Industrial Communications driver.

## Usage

These vi's are used for measuring the speed of the machine wheel as well as reading CAN data off of the bus in real time. The digital I/O bit toggle vi is more general use for I/O.

## Contributing

Any contributions and commits are welcome. If you would like to make a major change please open an ssue so the change may be discussed.
